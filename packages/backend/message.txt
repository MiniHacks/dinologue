## Audio Summary:

The audio clip is very short and contains a few people talking over each other. It's difficult to understand the exact context or topic of discussion due to the overlapping voices. 

Here's what can be discerned:

* **Multiple speakers:** There are at least 3 different people speaking.
* **Disagreement:**  The phrases "What's wrong with that?" repeated multiple times suggest some form of disagreement or questioning of an idea or opinion.
* **Positive comment:** One speaker expresses a positive sentiment with "So awesome" and "great video". 
* **Abbreviation:** The clip ends with the letters "P P P" which could be an abbreviation or acronym, but the meaning is unclear without further context.
